### Introduction
The group of hormones known as estrogens are responsible for regulating bones, skin, and organ growth,
among other essential bodily functions. Estrogens often serve to disrupt processes within the endocrine
system (hormone pathways), which is completely benign when occurring as a natural bodily process. Over
the past ten years, however, the increased production of many synthetic and plant products has raised
concerns over the potentially adverse impacts these chemicals have on the human body. Chemicals that have
estrogenic effects have been labeled environmental estrogens.
One method for testing the estrogenic effects of these environmental estrogens is the rat uterotrophic bioassay,
which observes the uterus growth response to varying levels of estrogen agonists and antagonists. The
expectation is that uterus weight will increase as the amount of prescribed estrogen agonist increases and
decreases as the amount of estrogen antagonist increases.
This analysis examines the data from one such uteroptophic bioassay study to determine if the process was
successful in identifying both the estrogenic effects of environmental estrogens, and the anti-estrogenic effects
of antagonist chemicals. This analysis also examines if and how these effects vary across the laboratories
involved in the study and examines how different dosing protocols may have affected the ability to detect
the effects of the two chemical
